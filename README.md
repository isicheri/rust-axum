# 🦀 Axum Rust Web Server — From Simple Start to Deeper Dive

This project is a lightweight, async web server built using [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), a web framework for Rust focused on ergonomics and type safety.

Following the [Shuttle guide](https://www.shuttle.dev/blog/2023/12/06/using-axum-rust), this repo explores building a real-world-ready web backend — starting small and going deeper step by step.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers
